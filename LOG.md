# Project log

Append-only. Every LLM session records what it did here so later sessions
can understand the project's history. Newest entry last.

## 2026-07-19 — Project initialization (session 1)

Input: `init.md`. Goal: initialize an LLM-friendly Go project skeleton — no
product source files yet, only agent rules, docs, cross-cutting concerns.

Done:

- `go mod init github.com/itsmjasadi/wrapper` (Go 1.26). Module path was a
  placeholder — renamed in session 2, see below.
- Researched tech stack, wrote `docs/research.md`. Choices: stdlib `net/http`
  for serving, `coder/websocket` for realtime, official `openai/openai-go` +
  `anthropics/anthropic-sdk-go` for consuming providers and for wire-compatible
  request/response types when *serving* those APIs, logrus + viper + otel for
  cross-cutting. All permissive licenses.
- Downloaded Effective Go to `docs/effective_go.html`; distilled it into the
  enforceable rule set `docs/effective-go-rules.md`.
- Wrote `CLAUDE.md`: all agent rules from init.md (logging in this file,
  markdown artifacts, effective.go per package, ≤3-method interfaces,
  mock.go per exported interface, error wrapping style, MonitoredX telemetry
  wrapper convention, thin main, internal/ vs pkg/).
- Read `~/Desktop/projects/gateway/src` for style influence (cerr sentinel
  errors, viper env prefix, otel graceful shutdown). This project improves on
  it: no global config state (Loader returns a value), providers behind
  interfaces with mocks, errors double-wrapped (`%w: %w`).
- Created packages, each with `effective.go`, `mock.go`, full-branch tests:
  - `internal/config` — viper env loader (`WRAPPER_` prefix, 12-factor),
    `Loader` interface, validation of `WRAPPER_ENV` (local|production).
  - `internal/logging` — logrus level/format init, `Initializer` interface.
  - `internal/telemetry` — `Provider` interface; noop when disabled (local),
    OTLP gRPC metrics when enabled (production). Documents the MonitoredX
    convention for future metric-bearing packages.
  - `internal/app` — pure wiring (`Runner`): config → logging → telemetry →
    block until signal; telemetry shutdown deferred, shutdown errors logged
    not returned.
  - `cmd/wrapper` — thin `main`: flags, signal context, `app.New().Run(ctx)`.
- `gofmt`, `go vet`, `go build`, `go test ./...` all pass.

Environment quirk: the shell's `GOPROXY` resolves to an empty list; go
commands that fetch modules need `GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct`
prefixed. Not persisted with `go env -w` on purpose (user's machine config).

Deliberate deferrals (marked with `ponytail:` comments in code):

- No HTTP server / routes yet — product features are the next step.
- `cmd/wrapper` has a single implicit `serve` command; add a command switch
  when a second command exists.
- `pkg/` is empty; the embeddable library surface gets designed with the
  product.

Next step (per init.md): discuss features, discover the product, then build.

## 2026-07-19 — GitHub publish (session 2)

- User created https://github.com/force1267/big-brain — the project's home.
- Renamed module `github.com/itsmjasadi/wrapper` → `github.com/force1267/big-brain`
  (go.mod + all imports); build and tests still green.
- `git init` (branch `main`), remote `origin` → the repo, initial commit pushed.
- Local directory is still named `wrapper/`; the repo name is `big-brain`.

Next: product discovery (unchanged).
